							<li> 1639</li>
							<li> The Hosmer House. The Post Office at the Hosmer house sold penny candy, bubble gum and baseball cards to the kids while their parents socialized during evening mail pickup, a popular activity at this town gathering place. </li>
							<li> The Wayside Inn is undoubtedly the longest continuing business in town. </li>
							<li> James Abram Garfield</li>
							<li> In 1923, Henry Ford stepped in to protect the Wayside Inn as a “splendid example of colonial America.”</li>
							<li> Built in 1929 by renowned hydraulic engineer J.B. Campbell, the Wayside Inn Grist Mill produces approximately 5 tons of flour per year. The Grist Mill was used by Pepperidge Farm as a full-time production facility from 1952-1967 and is the basis for their company logo. <a href="http://www.wayside.org/tour/wayside-inn-grist-mill" target="new">(http://www.wayside.org/tour/wayside-inn-grist-mill)</a></li>
							<li> Purchasing the old Perry farm on Dutton Road, Babe named it Home Plate and tried his hand at gentleman farming, raising chickens, turkeys, cows and horses.</li>
							<li> Sudbury sent the largest contingent (346) to Concord on April 19, 1775.</li>
							<li> Diagonally across the Wayside Inn Road from the Mill stands the Martha Mary Chapel. 
							This building was conceived by Henry Ford and was built using the timber from pine trees on this property which had blown 
							down in the 1938 hurricane. Much of the work was performed by people who lived, worked or attended one of the three schools 
							on the estate. Ground was broken in 1939 and completed with the installation of a weather vane on Ford’s birthday, July 30th, 1940.</li>
							<li> In the 1970′s, some town businesses and school children teamed up to do something on their own about Sudbury’s environment. Known as P.R.I.D.E. (Post Road Indeed Deserves Effort) they formed teams to clean up Rt. 20.</li>
